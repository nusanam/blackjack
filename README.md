My first project created with my two other CS prep group members.

In theory, this was a simple project but thinking about all of the steps that needed to be done was challenging.
We had only about a day (less than 24 hours) to come up with something basic to showcase what we learned
in our Codesmith Prep class. 

Why did we choose to do this? To have fun!

We decided to separate the code into:
  1) createDeck function
  2) shuffleDeck function
  3a) dealCard function to deal cards 
  3b) hitMe function to deal additional cards after the initial two
  4) start game function that included all of the "instructional" coding for what to do to run the game
  5) at the end of the game, we used a handCheck function to determine whether a player or the house decided to win the game
  
Stretch features could include CSS to render cards and make the game look more polished, adding multiplayer functionality, and a table to 
keep track of the wins and losses.
